This directory contains integration [Cram tests](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/cram.html)
for HIP and SLEEK. These were initially generated using `make_hip_tests.py` and
`make_sleek_tests.py` from the old set of tests in `examples/working/`,
but you do not need to run these again to add tests.

Postprocessing scripts to help filter out the outputs of HIP and SLEEK are
available in `test_assets/`. These scripts are automatically made visible 
at the `dune-tests` directory.
