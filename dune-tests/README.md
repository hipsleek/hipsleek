This directory contains integration [Cram tests](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/cram.html)
for HIP and SLEEK. 

Postprocessing scripts to help filter out the outputs of HIP and SLEEK are
available in `test_assets/`. These scripts are automatically made visible 
at the `dune-tests` directory.
